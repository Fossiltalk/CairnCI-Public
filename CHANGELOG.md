# Changelog

All notable changes to CairnCI are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Consumers pin the reusable
workflows by major tag (e.g. `@v1`); see
[docs/consumer-setup.md](docs/consumer-setup.md).

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **`omnistudioStandardRuntimeFirst` deploy setting** — opt-in 2-step deploy
  path on `sf-deploy.yml` (config key `omnistudioStandardRuntimeFirst`, input
  `omnistudio-standard-runtime-first`): changed OmniStudio Standard Runtime
  content (`OmniScript`, `OmniIntegrationProcedure`, `OmniDataTransform`,
  `OmniUiCard`) deploys in its own step before the rest of the changed
  metadata, mirroring the `ruleDeploy` split pattern. Adjacent OmniStudio
  config/tracking types stay in the main deploy. Delta mode only; quick deploy
  is bypassed when OmniStudio changes are present. Does not apply to
  managed-package (`vlocity_cmt`) OmniStudio. See
  [docs/consumer-setup.md](docs/consumer-setup.md) §5e.
- **permset-access-gate extension** — an org-free PR gate
  (`.github/actions/permset-access-gate/`) that inspects the current PR's git
  diff for newly created Salesforce custom fields and objects and verifies that
  the permission sets committed in the repo grant a configured minimum access
  level to each. No org connection and no `sf` CLI: pure git plus filesystem,
  so it adds no round trips to the pipeline. Config is source-tracked in the
  consumer repo (default `.cairnci/permset-access-gate.json`; see
  `examples/permset-access-gate.json`) with per-permission-set rules, a
  severity of `error` (blocking) or `warn` (non-blocking), and bypass patterns
  that apply globally or to a single rule. Findings surface as GitHub
  annotations, a job-summary table, and a sticky PR comment listing every
  missing permission, with an exit code following the extension contract
  (`0` ok, `10` warn, `1` error, `2` config/environment). Runs standalone or
  through the extension caller. See
  [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).

  The Salesforce-specific rules it encodes were verified with check-only
  deploys against a live org: required and master-detail fields cannot carry
  field permissions at all (exempt); formula, auto-number and roll-up summary
  fields accept `editable` but can never honor it, so an `edit` requirement
  downgrades to `read` rather than failing the PR; and a master-detail child
  object accepts View All / Modify All but additionally requires `read` on its
  master in the same permission set, which the gate reports as a
  `master-dependency` finding.

  Because Salesforce accepts `editable=true` on a formula, auto-number or
  roll-up field while the org stores `editable=false`, the gate also reports
  that as a `field-drift` finding at the rule's severity — on by default, since
  the grant reads as meaningful in review but has no effect in the org. Turn it
  off with `flagEditableOnReadOnlyFields: false`, globally or on a single rule.

- **omnistudio-standard-runtime-cache-refresh extension** — a post-deploy
  drift check and forced reactivation for OmniStudio **Standard Runtime**
  components (`.github/actions/omnistudio-standard-runtime-cache-refresh/`).
  Not applicable to the `vlocity_cmt` managed-package runtime. Reads the
  deploy's own delta manifest (Metadata API types `OmniScript`,
  `OmniIntegrationProcedure`, `OmniUiCard`, `OmniDataTransform`), SOQL-checks
  active state on the SObject layer (`OmniProcess` / `OmniUiCard` /
  `OmniDataTransform`, where manifest fullName = `UniqueName`), and only for
  out-of-sync components drives the org's own compile/activation Visualforce
  pages (`omnistudio__OmniLwcCompile`, `omnistudio__FlexCardCompilePage`)
  with a headless browser, reusing the deploy job's existing `sf` session via
  `frontdoor.jsp` — no credential inputs. Success requires a SOQL re-check;
  anything unconfirmed becomes an `OmniStudio (Standard Runtime):` `::warning`
  plus a job-summary row and the job still succeeds — **warn-only by design**
  (a deliberate deviation from `field-permset-gate`'s fail-on-violation; no
  rollback, drift is re-detected on every subsequent run). Config via inputs
  and/or `.cairnci/omnistudio-standard-runtime-policy.json`
  (`examples/omnistudio-standard-runtime-policy.json`) with **input > file >
  default** precedence, matching core's `.cairnci/config.json` convention.
  Unlike its dependency-free siblings it bundles `puppeteer-core` via
  `@vercel/ncc` into a checked-in `dist/` (no run-time install; uses the
  runner's preinstalled Chrome). See
  [docs/omnistudio-standard-runtime.md](docs/omnistudio-standard-runtime.md).

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Extension caller framework** — an optional, source-tracked way to hook
  consumer-developed extensions into the pipeline. Consumers commit
  `.cairnci/extensions.json` (see `examples/extensions.json`) listing
  extensions in run order, pinned to lifecycle phases (`pre-validate`,
  `post-validate-success`, `post-validate-failure`, `pre-deploy`,
  `post-deploy-success`, `post-deploy-failure`), each configurably blocking or
  non-blocking. Extensions are local scripts in the consumer repo or entries
  in any external git repo pinned to a ref (cloned outside the workspace).
  Exit-code contract: `0` = ok, `10` = warn (never blocks), anything else =
  error (blocks only when `blocking: true`). New `extensions-config-file`
  input on `sf-validate.yml` and `sf-deploy.yml`. The caller
  (`.github/actions/extension-caller/`) is core framework: it publishes to
  CairnCI-Public together with the reusable workflows on every core `v*` tag
  and the workflows reference it at
  `Fossiltalk/CairnCI-Public/.github/actions/extension-caller@v1`, so both
  always come from the same release (`publish-extension.yml` refuses
  `extension-caller/v*` tags). Extension development happens on the
  `CairnCI-External` branch; extensions still release to CairnCI-Extensions
  via the scoped-tag pipeline. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md).

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-07-14

Toolchain reproducibility and Node.js compatibility. The reusable workflows now
default to a pinned, validated toolchain instead of floating dist-tags. Consumers
pinning `@v1` pick this up automatically; the workflow inputs are unchanged, so
you can still override any version.

### Changed

- **Default Node.js version is now `22`** (was `20`). `@salesforce/cli` 2.142+
  bundles an `undici` that calls `worker_threads.markAsUncloneable` (Node
  >= 22.10) at CLI load, so Node 20 now crashes with
  `TypeError: markAsUncloneable is not a function`. Override with `node-version`
  if needed (sfdx-git-delta still requires >= 20).
- **Default `@salesforce/cli` is now pinned to `2.142.7`** (was the floating
  `latest` dist-tag), for a reproducible toolchain.
- **Default `sfdx-git-delta` is now pinned to `6.31.0`** (was the floating
  `stable` dist-tag).

### Added

- **[SF CLI compatibility table](docs/compatibility.md)** — the
  `@salesforce/cli` versions CairnCI has validated end-to-end against a real org
  (with Node version and date), so you know which version is safe to pin. Kept
  current automatically.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-07-03

First stable public release. The `sf-validate` and `sf-deploy` reusable
workflows are published to
[Fossiltalk/CairnCI-Public](https://github.com/Fossiltalk/CairnCI-Public) and
pinnable at `@v1`.

### Added

- **`sf-validate`** reusable workflow — check-only `sf project deploy validate`
  on pull requests, `RunLocalTests` by default, with a configurable
  minimum-coverage gate (`min-coverage`).
- **`sf-deploy`** reusable workflow — branch→environment deploys on merge,
  reusing the PR's validation for a quick deploy with automatic full-deploy
  fallback.
- **Delta and full-branch modes** (`delta`) via
  [sfdx-git-delta](https://github.com/scolladon/sfdx-git-delta); full-branch
  mode skips the plugin entirely.
- **Destructive-change validation** (`allow-destructive-changes`) — validates
  metadata deletions detected between refs.
- **Matching/duplicate rule deploys** (`rule-deploy`) — 3-step
  deactivate→update→activate path, with active-rule-limit preflight checks.
- **`org-mode: scratch`** on `sf-validate` — validate against an ephemeral
  scratch org created from a Dev Hub (`DEVHUB_SFDX_AUTH_URL`) and deleted
  afterward.
- **Rollback strategies** (`rollback-strategy`) — `none`, `revert-pr`, or
  `revert-push` to re-align git with the org after a failed deploy.
- **Configuration** via workflow inputs and/or an in-repo
  `.cairnci/config.json`, freely mixed (explicit input → config file →
  built-in default).
- **Pinnable toolchain** — Node, `@salesforce/cli`, and sfdx-git-delta versions
  are all overridable; runs on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners.
- Two adoption paths — reference a pinned `@v1` (recommended) or vendor the
  workflows in-repo (air-gapped / strict-security orgs).

### Notes

- The optional field-permission-set governance gate lives in
  [CairnCI-Extensions](https://github.com/Fossiltalk/CairnCI-Extensions),
  versioned independently and referenced as
  `Fossiltalk/CairnCI-Extensions/.github/actions/field-permset-gate@v1`.

## [v0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Initial pre-release: `sf-validate`, `sf-deploy` reusable workflows
- `field-permset-gate` composite action (later moved to CairnCI-Extensions)
- Delta and full-branch deploy modes
- `rollback-strategy`: `revert-pr` and `revert-push`
